# Welcome to Bryan Butler's GitHub page

Here you can look at some of my work history. Don't worry kind traveler, I have taken the liberty of tidying up and keeping everything in chronological order. You should be able to get a snapshot of the work that I have done, and am currently doing from this point. The best way to get to the bottom of a burning question you find here, is to ask the butler himself [Bryan Butler](mailto:bryanbutler42@gmail.com).

I hope you enjoy your stay and feel free to contact me with any questions you have.

## Schooling
I graduated with an associates degree from SouthHills School of Business and Technology. Here I've left the repo exactly as I commited it. I feel it's important to show progress and humility where you can. There are alot of things I would have done differently, not the least of which would be better git commits.


## Internship
I did my internship at the Clearinghouse for Military Family Readiness at Penn State. In the beginning I did my work in Drupal 7, under a parent theme developed by my organization. I made custom views and template files to display sponsors and team members on the webpage. You can view the project, [The Verterans Metrics Initiative](tvmi.militaryfamilies.psu.edu), as it was last touched in 2015.

## Employment
### Clearinghouse for Military Family Readiness
I after my internship I was offered a fulltime position with the Clearinghouse for Military Family Readiness and during my time there I devloped modules for the adapt framework, to help in the data collection of classes. I created a module that allowed for multiple correct answers which can be found here.[]

After that we moved away from Drupal and under new guidance became a WordPress house. I was responsible for the construction of multiple sites by taking a design and reconstructing it with the parent theme that was designated. While I can't upload those because they're actively being used, and proprietary, you're free to go and look at those sites which I will have listed below.
